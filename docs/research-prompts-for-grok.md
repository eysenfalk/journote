Generated: 2025-11-15  
Project: Life.D (ADHD life management + systems thinking trainer)  
Target: Grok 4 with web access

## Prompt 1: Market Research (ADHD Productivity Tools)

```
I'm building Life.D - a cross-platform (Flutter) life management app specifically for ADHD users that combines quick capture, tasks, habits, and graph visualization to show how life choices cascade through everything (relationships, work, health). It secretly trains systems thinking and integral consciousness.

Research the market for me (use 2024-2025 data):

1. ADHD productivity app market:
   - Market size and growth rate
   - Key players and their revenue/user numbers
   - What ADHD users are paying for vs. struggling with
   - Gaps in current solutions

2. PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) market:
   - Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research - user counts, revenue, growth
   - What features drive retention vs. churn
   - How people actually use linking/graph features

3. Systems thinking tools market:
   - Any commercial tools teaching systems thinking
   - Integral theory/consciousness development app space
   - Is there a market for "Yellow-stage" consciousness tools?

4. Cross-platform notes/productivity trends:
   - What's working in 2025 for Flutter/web/mobile apps
   - Pricing models that work (freemium, subscription, one-time)
   - User acquisition channels for productivity tools

Include specific numbers, sources, and URLs. Flag any data you're uncertain about.

## Prompt 2: Competitive Intelligence (Deep Dive)

```
I'm building Life.D - an ADHD-friendly life OS that visualizes life as an interconnected system (graph view showing how habits affect work, relationships, health). It combines Notion's databases + Obsidian's linking + ADHD-specific features.

Deep competitive analysis on:

1. **Notion** (2025 state):
   - Current user base, revenue, pricing
   - What do ADHD users love/hate about it
   - Their AI features and roadmap
   - Weaknesses we can exploit

2. **Obsidian** (2025 state):
   - Community size, plugin ecosystem health
   - What graph view features are most used
   - Their business model success
   - Why do people bounce from Obsidian

3. **ADHD-specific apps** (Goblin Tools, Tiimo, Brain Focus, etc.):
   - Which ones have traction
   - What features keep ADHD users engaged
   - Pricing and monetization
   - What they're missing

4. **Systems thinking tools** (if any exist):
   - Apps teaching causal loop diagrams, systems mapping
   - Integral theory apps or communities
   - Market demand signals

5. **Habit tracking apps** (Habitica, Streaks, etc.):
   - What gamification works vs. feels fake
   - How they handle ADHD users
   - Real vs. fake engagement metrics

Include user reviews, Reddit/X discussions, and specific feature comparisons. Show me where the white space is.

## Prompt 3: User Research (ADHD Community Insights)

```
I'm building Life.D for ADHD users. Research what ADHD communities are saying right now (2025):

1. **ADHD productivity pain points** (Reddit r/ADHD, X, forums):
   - Top complaints about existing tools (Notion, Todoist, etc.)
   - What features ADHD users BEG for but don't exist
   - Why they abandon productivity apps
   - What actually works for them long-term

2. **ADHD and systems thinking**:
   - Do ADHD people naturally think in systems/connections?
   - Interest in "seeing how everything affects everything"
   - Integral theory / consciousness evolution in ADHD communities

3. **Key features ADHD users need**:
   - Reminder systems that actually work
   - Gamification that doesn't feel patronizing
   - Quick capture (widget, voice, etc.)
   - Visual progress tracking
   - Collaboration with partners/family

4. **Willingness to pay**:
   - What do ADHD users actually pay for
   - Price sensitivity
   - Freemium vs. subscription preferences

5. **Discovery channels**:
   - Where do ADHD users find new tools
   - Influencers, subreddits, Discord communities
   - What messaging resonates

Pull direct quotes from recent discussions (2024-2025). Show me the language they use.

## Prompt 4: Technical Research (Stack Validation)

```
I'm building Life.D with Flutter (web + mobile + desktop) + Supabase (Postgres) + AI/RAG. Validate my tech choices:

1. **Flutter for cross-platform (2025)**:
   - Success stories of Flutter web + mobile apps
   - Performance concerns or wins
   - Community health, package ecosystem
   - Should I worry about web performance vs. React?

2. **Supabase for backend**:
   - Self-hosting experiences (good/bad)
   - Postgres handling graph-like queries (bidirectional links)
   - Real-time sync for collaboration
   - Scaling concerns for 10k+ users
   - Alternatives (Appwrite, PocketBase, Convex)?

3. **Graph database considerations**:
   - Should I use Postgres with graph extensions or Neo4j?
   - For life-as-a-system graph (habits → work → relationships)
   - Performance for real-time updates
   - Cost at scale

4. **AI/RAG implementation**:
   - Best practices for RAG on user's notes/journals (2025)
   - Privacy-preserving AI (local models vs. cloud)
   - Vector databases for semantic search
   - Open-source LLMs vs. OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
   - Pattern detection in journal entries

5. **Cross-platform sync**:
   - Offline-first architecture patterns
   - Conflict resolution for collaborative editing
   - Battery/performance on mobile

Include recent benchmarks, case studies, and developer experiences from 2024-2025.
```

## Prompt 5: Domain Analysis (Integral Theory + Systems Thinking)

```
I'm positioning Life.D as a consciousness evolution tool disguised as productivity software. Research:

1. **Integral theory / Spiral Dynamics community (2025)**:
   - Community size and engagement
   - Where do Yellow/Turquoise thinkers hang out online
   - Demand for tools that train systems thinking
   - Willingness to pay for consciousness development

2. **Systems thinking adoption**:
   - Who's teaching systems thinking in 2025
   - Commercial success of systems thinking tools
   - Corporate vs. personal interest
   - Educational market

3. **Consciousness tech market**:
   - Apps focused on personal development / consciousness
   - Waking Up, Headspace - but more "integral"
   - What's working, what's not
   - Pricing and user retention

4. **ADHD + systems thinking intersection**:
   - Do ADHD brains naturally see connections?
   - Any research on ADHD and integral development
   - Yellow-stage ADHDers - are they a real demographic?

5. **Marketing to "Yellow" consciousness**:
   - Language that resonates
   - Communities (Twitter, Reddit, forums)
   - Influencers in integral/systems space
   - How to avoid sounding too "woo"

Show me if there's a real market here or if this is niche hobby territory.

## Prompt 6: Pricing & Monetization Research

```
I'm building Life.D (ADHD + systems thinking tool). Research monetization strategies:

1. **ADHD app pricing** (2025 data):
   - What ADHD users actually pay monthly
   - Freemium conversion rates
   - One-time purchase vs. subscription success
   - Price points that work

2. **PKM tool pricing** (Notion, Obsidian, Roam):
   - Their exact pricing tiers
   - Free tier limitations that drive upgrades
   - What features are worth paying for
   - Lifetime deals vs. subscriptions

3. **Open source + paid hosting models**:
   - Success stories (Supabase, Ghost, etc.)
   - Self-host free, pay for cloud
   - Community goodwill vs. revenue

4. **Indie SaaS benchmarks (2025)**:
   - Solo founder revenue expectations
   - CAC (customer acquisition cost) for productivity tools
   - Churn rates to expect
   - Path to $10k MRR

5. **Yellow/integral market willingness to pay**:
   - Do systems thinkers pay for tools?
   - Price sensitivity
   - Patronage/donation models vs. hard paywall

Give me realistic numbers for a solo founder launching in 2026.
