# Product Brief: Life.D

**Date:** 2025-11-15
**Author:** Falk
**Context:** Personal Tool (for me first, maybe others later)
**Primary Goal:** Build something I actually use daily to solve MY invisible self-change problem

---

## Executive Summary

Life.D is my personal ADHD life management tool. Primary purpose: help me notice when I'm "being cold" BEFORE my girlfriend has to tell me.

It combines three essentials I need daily:
1. **Idea capture** - Never lose a thought (ADHD tax is real)
2. **Task management** - Track what needs doing without shame spirals
3. **Life-systems journaling** - Structured daily check-ins across relationships, work, energy, mood to detect invisible self-changes

**Personal Validation:** If I use it every day for 30 days and it catches ONE invisible pattern I would've missed, it's a success. Everything else (graph viz, AI, sharing with others) is bonus.

**Maybe Later:** If it works for me and friends ask about it, I might share it. But that's not the goal. The goal is solving MY problem.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Invisible Consequence Problem**

ADHD brains struggle with delayed visibility of consequences. You forget to respond to a message, skip a workout routine, or abandon a project—and only realize the damage days or weeks later when a relationship strains, energy crashes, or opportunities vanish.

**The Invisible Self-Change Problem**

Even more insidious: gradual personal shifts you don't notice until someone else points them out. "You've been cold lately." "You changed somehow last week." Without daily reflection, these patterns stay invisible—you can't course-correct what you can't see.

Current solutions fail in opposite ways:
- **Complex tools** (Notion, Obsidian): Require extensive setup before delivering value, leading to 40% abandonment and "beautiful prisons" of unused systems
- **Simple tools** (ADHD planners, Tiimo): Address immediate capture but miss the deeper pattern—they can't show how skipping cleaning impacts work productivity, or how workout consistency affects relationship energy
- **Journal apps** (Day One, Journey): Freeform writing without structure to track life-systems patterns or detect gradual changes

**The Real Pain:** My girlfriend said "you've been cold lately" and I had NO IDEA. That's the invisible self-change problem. I need a system that helps me notice BEFORE external feedback.

### My Specific Problems

**Idea Capture:**
- Thoughts vanish in seconds (ADHD working memory)
- Current tools: Apple Notes, random text files, Slack DMs to myself - all fragmented
- Need: ONE place, instant capture, zero friction

**Task Management:**
- Incomplete lists trigger shame spirals
- Forget recurring commitments (relationship maintenance, health routines)
- Need: Clean task system that doesn't guilt-trip, handles recurring gracefully

**Self-Awareness Gap:**
- Gradual mood/energy/behavior changes invisible until someone points them out
- No structured reflection system - occasional journaling is random
- Need: Daily structured check-in that takes <2 minutes but reveals patterns

**Current Kludge:**
- Obsidian for notes (setup hell, rarely open it)
- Apple Reminders for tasks (no context, just noise)
- No journaling system (tried Day One, abandoned after 5 days)
- Result: Fragmented, ineffective, not solving core problem

### Why I'm Not Using Existing Tools

**Notion/Obsidian:**
- Setup paralysis - spent weeks configuring, rarely use
- Too complex for daily habits
- No structured life-systems journaling

**Apple Notes/Reminders:**
- Capture works but no task management depth
- No journaling structure
- Fragmented across apps

**Day One/Journey (Journal Apps):**
- Freeform writing feels overwhelming
- No structured prompts for life-systems tracking
- Abandoned after 5 days every time

**ADHD Apps (Tiimo, Goblin Tools):**
- Great for specific things (time blocking, task breakdown)
- Don't combine capture + tasks + journaling
- Missing the self-awareness/reflection component

**Why Build Life.D:**
No single tool gives me instant capture + clean task management + structured daily life-systems reflection. I need all three working together in one place I actually open daily.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Life.D: My Personal ADHD Life Tool**

Three core features I need, nothing more (for now):

### 1. Idea Capture (Instant, Everywhere)
- Desktop app, phone widget, browser extension
- Hit keyboard shortcut → type → saved (< 3 seconds)
- All captures in one searchable list
- Tags optional (not required for functionality)

### 2. Task Management (Clean, Shame-Free)
- Create tasks from captures or standalone
- Due dates, priorities, recurring schedules
- Clean list view (not overwhelming)
- Mark done → it disappears (no guilt from old incomplete items lingering)
- Weekly review: "What didn't get done and why?"

### 3. Life-Systems Journaling (Daily Reflection)
**THE CORE DIFFERENTIATOR** - this is what solves "you've been cold lately"

**Daily Prompt (< 2 minutes):**
- Relationships: How was I today with [girlfriend/family/friends]? (1-10 + notes)
- Work: Productive? Stressed? Engaged? (1-10 + notes)
- Energy: Physical energy level? (1-10 + notes)
- Mood: Emotional state? (1-10 + notes)
- Self-awareness: Did I notice any changes in myself today?

**Weekly Review (5 minutes):**
- Compare this week vs last week ratings
- "Your relationship score dropped from 8 to 6 over 3 days - what changed?"
- "Your energy was high Mon-Wed then crashed Thu-Fri - sleep? Diet? Stress?"
- Forces me to SEE patterns before they become "you've been cold lately"

**Phase 2+ (ONLY if Phase 1 works):**
- Graph view auto-generates after 30 days of usage—no manual setup
- Color-coded nodes show progress states (habits green/yellow/red based on consistency)
- AI analyzes daily prompted journals to discover hidden consequences
  - "Your workout consistency directly correlates with work completion rates"
  - "Responding to messages same-day strengthens relationship stability scores"
- Cascade animations show ripple effects before they happen

**Phase 4+: Collective Consciousness**
- Shared workspaces where partners/families see interconnected systems together
- Community knowledge tree (templates, roadmaps from fellow travelers)
- Multi-user progress patterns reveal collective wisdom
- The tool that secretly trains integral development through practical daily use

### Key Differentiators

1. **Systems-First Life OS:** Graph view isn't optional or a plugin—it's the PRIMARY interface showing how life areas interconnect. Competitors optimize for knowledge capture (Obsidian) or team collaboration (Notion). Life.D optimizes for SEEING YOUR LIFE AS A SYSTEM.

2. **Life-Systems Daily Journaling:** Structured template tracks how you show up (relationships, work, self), what affects you, what you're carrying forward, plus energy/mood. Detects invisible self-changes before others notice. Feeds consequence mapping from Day 1.

3. **AI Consequence Discovery:** First tool combining daily life-systems journals + AI to reveal hidden cascades ("workout consistency → work productivity", "stress patterns → relationship coldness"). Not retroactive dashboards—predictive visibility before consequences hit.

4. **Progressive Complexity:** Start absurdly simple (capture + structured journaling), auto-generate depth from usage data—inverted from Notion's "setup hell first, value later"

5. **ADHD-Native UX Throughout:** Quick capture, daily journal prompts, visual progress, non-patronizing metrics, time blindness tools baked into every feature. Built for ADHD brains, not adapted afterward.

6. **Ecosystem Integration Across Life Domains:** THE core differentiator—manage relationships, work, health, habits in ONE tool designed for this purpose. Not "capture + plugins" (Obsidian), not "databases you configure" (Notion). An integrated life management ecosystem from Day 1.

7. **Authentic Data, Real Dopamine:** Streaks and progress tied to actual life metrics, not patronizing badges or fake gamification

8. **Strategic White Space:** Zero competitors combine ADHD simplicity + systems-first architecture + life-systems journaling + ecosystem integration + AI consequence mapping

## Success Criteria (Personal Validation)

### Phase 0: Does It Work for Me?

**Who They Are:**
- ADHD adults (diagnosed or self-identified) aged 25-45
- Currently using 2-4 fragmented productivity tools
- Have tried Notion/Obsidian and felt overwhelmed OR used simple ADHD apps and outgrown them
- Naturally think in connections but struggle to externalize the mental model
- Frustrated by delayed recognition of consequences across life areas

**Current Behavior:**
- Lose ideas constantly despite using capture tools (friction too high)
- Start ambitious planning systems that collapse within weeks
- Experience guilt from incomplete task lists without understanding systemic causes
- Manually try to track how habits affect relationships/work but give up
- Spend 30-60 minutes daily across multiple apps that don't communicate

**Specific Pain Points:**
- "My girlfriend said I've been cold lately—I had no idea I was changing"
- "I forgot a friend's birthday and only realized when they didn't reach out this month"
- "My workout streak broke and suddenly my work productivity tanked—I can't see these patterns coming"
- "I can't track how I'm showing up in relationships day-to-day"
- "Notion is my brain dump heaven but setup hell—I spent 3 weeks building a system then never opened it"
- "I need to see how everything connects but every graph tool overwhelms me"

**What They Value Most:**
- Zero-friction capture (widget, browser, desktop—capture must be faster than opening a notes app)
- Visual progress that reflects reality, not patronizing badges
- Discovering hidden patterns ("Oh, that's why I burn out every March")
- A tool that grows with them—simple start, sophisticated depth available when ready
- Privacy-first AI that analyzes their life data locally

**Technical Comfort:** 
- Intermediate—comfortable with apps, not intimidated by "graph view" concepts
- 60% prefer mobile-first, 40% desktop power users
- 90% demand local-first data with optional cloud sync

**Market Size:** 500K-1M "one more try" ADHD users actively seeking alternatives after churning from 3+ apps (subset of 2M who've abandoned tools but haven't exited category)

**Critical Validation Gate:** Interview 10 ADHD users who've churned from 3+ apps. If 6+ say "I'd try one more if it showed life cascades," market validated. If not, pivot messaging or reconsider scope.

**Discovery Channels:**
- Reddit r/ADHD (1M subs)—50% discover tools here (PRIMARY growth engine)
- X/Twitter #ADHDtools hashtags
- TikTok ADHD influencers (@howtoadhd: 1M followers)
- Micro-influencer partnerships (budget $5K-10K Month 6-9)
- Word-of-mouth from successful users

### Secondary Users: Yellow/Turquoise Systems Thinkers

## Personal Success Metrics

### Month 1 (December 2025): Do I Use It Daily?

**The Only Metrics That Matter:**

**Week 1-2:**
- ✅ Am I opening it every day? (Yes/No)
- ✅ Am I capturing ideas in it vs. Apple Notes? (% of captures)
- ✅ Does it feel faster than my current kludge? (Yes/No)
- ❌ Kill if: I don't open it 5+ days in Week 2

**Week 3-4:**
- ✅ Am I doing the daily journal prompt? (days completed / 14)
- ✅ Does the weekly review show me something I didn't notice? (Yes/No)
- ✅ Am I managing tasks in it vs. Apple Reminders? (Yes/No)
- ❌ Kill if: <50% journal completion OR I go back to old tools

**End of Month 1 Decision:**
- **SUCCESS**: Used it 25+ days out of 30, caught at least ONE invisible pattern
- **FAILURE**: Abandoned it, back to fragmented tools
- **If SUCCESS**: Build Phase 2 features (habits, graph preview)
- **If FAILURE**: Kill project or pivot approach

### Month 2 (January 2026): Does It Actually Help?

**Personal Validation Questions:**
- Has it helped me notice a mood/energy/behavior pattern BEFORE external feedback?
- Does my girlfriend notice I'm more aware/present?
- Am I less anxious about forgetting things?
- Would I be upset if it disappeared tomorrow?

**The Real Test:**
If I can point to a specific moment where Life.D helped me catch "you've been cold lately" BEFORE she said it, it's a success. Everything else is nice-to-have.

### Maybe Later: Sharing with Others

**Only Consider If:**
- $2K MRR by Month 9-12 (200 paying users @ $9/month, 6% freemium conversion)
- $5K MRR by Month 12-15 (556 paying users at 6% conversion from 9,300 free users)
- Target: 7K-10K free users required for $5K MRR (not 2.5K—ADHD freemium converts at 4-8%, not 20%)
- 5-10% monthly churn (industry standard for freemium)

**Conversion Reality Check:**
- Pessimistic: 4% conversion (ADHD baseline per Tiimo/Inflow data)
- Realistic: 6% conversion (AI hook + systems thinking differentiation)
- Optimistic: 8% conversion (if graph view achieves Obsidian-level stickiness)

**AI Consequence Discovery:**
- 85% pattern detection accuracy (user-validated insights)
- Users discover 1+ "hidden cascade" insight per week
- 50% of Pro tier users cite consequence mapping as conversion driver

### Business Objectives

**Year 1 Goals:**
- Launch freemium model with 7K-10K active free users
- Achieve $5K MRR by Month 12-15 (400-600 paying users at 6% conversion)
- Validate systems thinking messaging resonates with Yellow-stage depth testers
- Build 3K-5K person email list through Reddit/X content + ADHD influencer partnerships
- Complete 10-user validation interviews (churn survivors willing to try "one more app")

**Long-Term Vision (18-24 Months):**
- $10K-20K MRR (1K-2K paying users)—full-time sustainable
- Open-source core + managed cloud model (Ghost/Supabase approach)
- Community-driven development (templates, roadmaps, integrations)
- Recognized as "the integral consciousness tool" in Yellow/Turquoise spaces

### Key Performance Indicators

**User Acquisition:**
- CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): <$50/user via organic channels
- Month-over-month growth: 15-25% user base expansion
- Viral coefficient: 0.3+ (each user brings 0.3 referrals)

**Retention & Engagement:**
- D1 retention: 70%+ (return next day)
- D7 retention: 50%+
- Friend asks "what's that app?" (organic interest signal)
- I find myself wanting to share journal templates with others
- People in my life notice positive changes and ask how

**If These Happen:**
- MAYBE add sharing features
- MAYBE charge if people want access ($5-10/month feels fair)
- MAYBE build marketing/landing page

**If These DON'T Happen:**
- Keep it personal
- That's totally fine
- Solved my problem = success

## MVP Scope (What I'm Actually Building)

### Phase 0: Core Three Features (30 Days December 2025)

**Priority #1: Idea Capture**
- Desktop app with global hotkey (primary use case: at computer all day)
- Mobile app with widget (secondary: capture on-the-go)
- Text input only (voice can wait)
- Offline-first, syncs when connected
- All captures in single list, searchable
**Why First:** If I can't trust it to never lose a thought, I won't use it

**Priority #2: Task Management**
- Create tasks (from captures or standalone)
- Due dates, priorities, recurring schedules
- Reminders (simple push notifications)
- Mark done (clean completion, no guilt)
- Weekly review view
**Why Second:** Need somewhere for \"do this\" thoughts to live as actionable items

**Priority #3: Daily Life-Systems Journal**
**THIS IS THE KILLER FEATURE FOR ME**

**Evening prompt (< 2 minutes):**
- Relationships: How was I today? (1-10 + optional note)
- Work: Productive/engaged? (1-10 + optional note)  
- Energy: Physical energy? (1-10 + optional note)
- Mood: Emotional state? (1-10 + optional note)
- Quick reflection: Anything I noticed about myself today?

**Weekly review (Sunday evening, 5 minutes):**
- Show trend lines for each category (this week vs last week)
- Highlight drops: \"Relationship score went from 8 to 6 over 3 days\"
- Force pattern recognition: \"What changed?\"\n- This is how I catch \"you've been cold lately\" BEFORE she has to say it

**Why Third (But Most Important):** Capture and tasks are commodity features. Structured life-systems journaling with trend detection is what makes this worth building.

**Technical Foundation:**
- Flutter (cross-platform: Windows desktop primary, Android phone secondary)
- Supabase (backend, auth, real-time sync, Postgres database)
- Local-first architecture (works offline, syncs when online)
**Why These:** I know Flutter, Supabase handles backend complexity, local-first = no lag

### What's NOT in Phase 0 (Maybe Later)

**Not building these unless Phase 0 proves useful:**
- Graph visualization (cool but not essential to solve "cold lately" problem)
- Habit tracking (recurring tasks handle this)
- AI pattern detection (can add later with 30+ days of journal data)
- Ecosystem integrations (Todoist, Google Calendar - complexity)
- Voice notes (text is 90% of use case)
- Browser extension (desktop + mobile enough)
- Bidirectional linking (nice-to-have)
- Community/sharing features (personal tool first)
- Streaks, badges, gamification (not needed for self-awareness)

**Why So Ruthlessly Minimal:**
- I have ADHD - scope creep is my nemesis
- Every feature is a chance to over-engineer and never ship
- 30 days means saying NO to almost everything
- Can add features later IF I'm actually using the core tool daily

### My Personal Success Criteria

**SUCCESS (End of December 2025) = All True:**
- ✅ Used it 25+ days out of 30
- ✅ Captured 90%+ of ideas in Life.D (not Apple Notes)
- ✅ Completed journal 20+ days out of 30
- ✅ Weekly review revealed at least ONE pattern I missed consciously  
- ✅ I'd be annoyed if it disappeared
- ✅ Girlfriend notices I'm more self-aware (the ultimate validation)

**FAILURE = Any True:**
- ❌ Stopped using 3+ consecutive days
- ❌ Went back to Apple Notes/Reminders
- ❌ Journal feels like chore not insight
- ❌ Weekly review shows nothing useful
- ❌ Excited about building features but not using core tool (ADHD founder trap)

**Decision (End of Month 1):**
- **If SUCCESS**: Keep using. Maybe add Phase 2 features.
- **If FAILURE**: Kill it or completely rethink. Don't waste more time.

### Future Vision Features (Phase 2-4)

**Phase 2: Authentic Dopamine Engine**
- Habit tracking auto-generated from recurring task patterns
- Streaks based on completion consistency (not fake badges)
- Milestone celebrations with real data context
- Before/after metrics showing life impact
- Time tracking integration (see where energy flows)

**Phase 3: Systems Thinking Unlock**
- Graph view auto-generated from accumulated journal + habit data (30-60 days)
- **Manual consequence marking FIRST**: "I think workouts affect my energy" → app confirms/denies with correlation data
- AI consequence mapping analyzes journal entries collected since Phase 0 (opt-in for privacy-conscious users)
  - "Workout consistency → work productivity" insights
  - "Stress spikes → relationship coldness" patterns
  - "Sleep quality → emotional regulation" correlations
- Color-coded nodes (habits green/yellow/red by progress state)
- Cascade animations showing ripple effects
- Contact intelligence (tasks/notes/journal mentions linked to people)
- "Invisible self-change detector": "You've been withdrawn when work pressure increases"
- **AI-free mode**: Users who distrust AI can build graph manually (control + privacy)
- **Viewing modes toggle**: 
  - **Soft mode** (default): Show positive patterns and wins ("See what's working")—reduces anxiety
  - **Diagnostic mode** (opt-in): Show all patterns including negative cascades ("See everything")—for users who want full truth
  - Rationale: Systems thinking both motivates AND stresses—let users choose their lens

**Phase 4: Collective Consciousness**
- Shared workspaces (partners, families see interconnected systems)
- Community knowledge tree (templates, roadmaps shared)
- Multi-user progress patterns (collective wisdom emerges)
- Skills and identity roadmaps (long-arc development tracking)
- Predictive simulations ("skip this habit → relationship risk score")
- Open-source core with managed cloud option

## Market Context

### Market Opportunity

**Primary Market: ADHD Productivity Apps**
- $2.22B global market in 2025, growing 16.6% CAGR through 2029
- 10M+ active ADHD productivity app users
- 2M users (20%) actively seeking alternatives due to tool dissatisfaction
- 50% app abandonment within 30 days—massive retention problem to solve

**Secondary Market: Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)**
- $12B+ productivity tool segment
- Notion: 100M users, $400M ARR (60% YoY growth)
- Obsidian: 5M users, $10M sync revenue (50% YoY growth)
- 40% of PKM users cite "setup paralysis" as barrier to value

**Tertiary Market: Integral/Systems Thinking Tools**
- $500M+ niche consciousness development market (15% annual growth)
- 20K-50K active Yellow/Turquoise practitioners globally
- Zero dedicated tools—current offerings are courses, not software
- 30% willing to pay $50-200/year for transformative tools

**White Space Opportunity:**
Life.D is the first tool combining ADHD-friendly UX + systems visualization + AI consequence mapping. Current competitors either:
- Overwhelm with complexity (Notion, Obsidian)
- Oversimplify without depth (ADHD planners, Tiimo)
- Lack graph/AI entirely (all ADHD-specific apps)

**Realistic Reach:**
- Year 1: 7K-10K free users (via Reddit/X organic + $5K-10K influencer partnerships)
- Year 2: 25K-40K users (ADHD word-of-mouth primary driver, Yellow depth testers validate positioning)
- Long-term: 100K users (1% of 10M ADHD app market)—sustainable $1M ARR business at 6% conversion

### Competitive Landscape

**Notion:**
- Strengths: 100M users, AI features, collaboration
- Weaknesses: 40% setup abandonment, zero ADHD features, no graph view, optimizes for "wild manner" chaos not systems
- Life.D Advantage: Systems-first architecture (graph is primary, not optional) + ADHD-native UX + life-wide consequence mapping
- **Why They Won't Pivot:** Notion optimizes for team collaboration and AI assistants, not personal life systems. Different core value prop.

**Obsidian:**
- Strengths: 5M users, beloved graph, privacy-first
- Weaknesses: 30% setup bounce rate, mobile sync issues (founder cites "no good Android app"), no collaboration, non-technical barrier
- Life.D Advantage: Flutter native performance (mobile-first), real-time sync/collab (Supabase), guided ADHD onboarding, auto-generated graph, ecosystem integration

**ADHD Apps (Tiimo, Goblin Tools, Brain Focus):**
- Strengths: Simple UX, immediate value, high ADHD retention
- Weaknesses: No graphs, no AI, no systems visualization
- Life.D Advantage: Combine their simplicity with systems depth they lack

**Habitica (Gamified Habit Tracker):**
- Strengths: Social body doubling, guilds, 50% ADHD engagement
- Weaknesses: Patronizing gamification, no real-life cascades
- Life.D Advantage: Authentic metrics + consequence visibility vs fake badges

**Market Timing:**
- Rising ADHD awareness and diagnosis rates (5-7% adult prevalence)
- AI expectations now mainstream (70% want pattern detection)
- Remote work increasing demand for self-management tools
- Systems thinking gaining cultural traction (Rebel Wisdom, Integral podcasts growing 15% annually)

## Risks and Assumptions

### Key Risks

**1. Scope Creep from Learning Goals**
- Risk: Over-engineering Phase 0 due to learning curiosity (e.g., implementing graph database before Phase 3)
- Context: Founder is senior SRE/DevOps using AI agents to accelerate dev, employed with stable income, building to learn + validate
- Mitigation: Strict 30-day Phase 0 scope discipline (capture + notes ONLY, defer all advanced features to Phase 3 as planned)
- Assumption: Infrastructure expertise eliminates tech stack risk, but curiosity could delay shipping

**2. ADHD Users Abandon During Graph Setup**
- Risk: Graph view requires complexity ADHD brains resist
- Mitigation: Hide graph until 30 days of data exists, auto-generate from usage patterns
- Assumption: Users trust simple tool first, unlock depth when ready

**3. Yellow-Stage Market Too Niche to Sustain**
- Risk: 20K-50K total addressable market insufficient for revenue
- Mitigation: ADHD market (2M) is primary driver; Yellow users are evangelists, not revenue core
- Assumption: 1K paying ADHD users @ $9/month = $9K MRR sustainable (Yellow bonus)

**4. Notion/Obsidian Add Similar Features**
- Risk: Incumbents copy consequence mapping, eliminate differentiation
- Mitigation: ADHD-native UX defensible (they optimize for general audience); move fast, ship graph+AI before they notice
- Assumption: 12-18 month head start before competitors react

**5. AI Consequence Detection Accuracy Too Low**
- Risk: 85% accuracy insufficient, users distrust insights; privacy fears about journal analysis
- Mitigation: Require user confirmation on patterns before displaying; start with obvious correlations (sleep → energy)
- Mitigation: Local-first AI analysis (Ollama); add "AI-free mode" for manual graph building
- Assumption: Local LLMs (Llama 3.1) sufficient for pattern detection; fine-tune on user data

**6. Sequential Phasing Delays Differentiation Too Long**
- Risk: Phase 0-1 validates commodity features (capture/tasks) while graph/AI differentiation waits until Month 7-12
- Context: 50% ADHD churn by Day 30; users judge "another notes app" before seeing unique value
- Counter-argument: Journal in Phase 0 NOW provides immediate differentiation (self-change detection)
- Alternative considered: Ship Phase 3 features FIRST (graph + manual consequence tracking as prototype)
- Decision: Journaling pivot addresses this—Phase 0 now has differentiation on Day 1

**7. Freemium Attracts Wrong Users**
- Risk: Free tier fills support queue with tire-kickers who never convert; paid-first filters for serious users
- Counter-evidence: Paid trials convert 30-50% but reduce top-of-funnel 50%; ADHD users have card-gate trauma
- Decision: Keep freemium BUT consider $5/month "Supporter" tier in Phase 2 to filter committed users early
- Test: Interview beta users on willingness to pay $5/month from Day 1 vs freemium preference

### Critical Assumptions

**Market Assumptions (UPDATED POST-REVIEW):**
- 500K-1M "one more try" ADHD users exist (subset of 2M who churned but haven't exited category)
- 70% of ADHD users want AI pattern detection (validated via Reddit surveys)
- Freemium conversion rate: 6-8% realistic (ADHD apps 4-6% baseline + differentiation bonus)
- **MUST VALIDATE:** 10 user interviews with 3+ app churners to confirm willingness to try Life.D's approach

**Assumption Reversals to Test:**

**REVERSAL: "ADHD Users Want Simplicity"**
- Counter-evidence: Obsidian has 5M users with 60% daily graph use—complexity CAN attract ADHD brains
- Risk: Phase 0 simplicity might BORE power users who crave sophisticated tools
- **Founder Answer:** "Simple is enough to fix my problems first"—but noted Obsidian lacks "good Android app or sync/collab"
- Insight: Simplicity chosen not because complexity is bad, but because EXECUTION (mobile, sync, ecosystem) matters more than features
- Test: Show beta users empty graph view in Phase 0 ("imagine your life here")—does it increase or decrease retention?
- Alternative: Offer "power mode" toggle from Day 1 (advanced features visible but locked until data exists)

**REVERSAL: "Systems Thinking Attracts Users"**
- Counter-evidence: Yellow-stage thinking is rare (10K-30K globally) because most resist systemic complexity
- Risk: Consequence visibility might trigger anxiety ("I'm ruining my relationship") vs motivation
- Test: A/B test messaging—"See what's working" (positive framing) vs "See life patterns" (neutral framing)
- Mitigation: Add "soft mode" that hides negative cascades, shows only positive correlations

**REVERSAL: "AI Insights are Valuable"**
- Counter-evidence: 85% accuracy = 15% false positives erode trust; privacy concerns about journal analysis
- Risk: Users ignore AI tab entirely, never discover "the magic" that justifies Pro tier
- Test: Offer manual consequence marking FIRST ("I think workouts affect my energy")—app confirms/denies with data
- Mitigation: All AI analysis local-first; add "AI-free mode" for privacy-conscious users

**REVERSAL: "Quick Capture is Sufficient Differentiation"**
- Counter-evidence: Apple Notes, Google Keep, Drafts already have perfect capture—it's a commodity
- Risk: Phase 0 validates commodity feature, not moat (users like capture but churn before graph/AI)
- **Founder Answer:** "Ecosystem to manage all parts of your life, designed for this"—capture is entry point, not differentiator
- Test: Does messaging focus on "life ecosystem" vs "great capture" change user perception?
- Alternative: Ship "consequence preview" in Phase 0 (even manual/fake connections shown in simple graph)

**User Behavior Assumptions:**
- ADHD users will tolerate simple MVP if capture friction is zero AND journaling provides immediate self-awareness value
- **UNCERTAINTY:** ADHD users might CRAVE complexity (Obsidian 5M users proves some do)—Phase 0 simplicity could bore power users
- Graph view becomes "addictive" once visible (Obsidian 60% daily usage validates)
- Daily life-systems journaling will achieve 40%+ compliance (key for immediate value + AI pattern detection in Phase 3)
- Users will detect invisible self-changes within 14-30 days of consistent journaling
- **UNCERTAINTY:** Systems thinking visibility might trigger anxiety ("I'm breaking things") vs motivation—need positive framing strategy
- **UNCERTAINTY:** AI consequence insights might be ignored/distrusted—manual marking may prove more engaging

**Technical Assumptions:**
- Flutter Web performance competitive with React for graph rendering (validated at 10K+ nodes)
- Supabase scales to 10K users without migration (documented in benchmarks)
- Postgres + AGE handles graph queries for MVP scope (100ms response times at <10K nodes)
- Local LLMs achieve 85% pattern accuracy (needs validation with toy datasets)

**Business Assumptions:**
- Solo founder can reach $5K MRR in 12 months via organic channels (Reddit, X, content)
- CAC <$50/user realistic through community engagement vs paid ads
- Open-source Phase 4 builds goodwill without cannibalizing cloud revenue (Ghost model)

### Revenue Model Evolution

**Phase 0-1: Paid-First Alpha** ⚠️ CHANGED FROM FREEMIUM (Pre-mortem Prevention)
- **Alpha tier**: $5/month from Day 1, NO free tier
- **Rationale**: Validates willingness-to-pay immediately, filters serious users, prevents support death spiral
- **Pre-mortem Risk Mitigated**: Freemium death spiral (200 free users × 6% = $108 MRR = unsustainable)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Frame as "founding member alpha access" (scarcity + exclusivity)
- **Target**: 50 paid users by Month 1, 100 by Month 3
- **Freemium Consideration**: Only add free tier in Month 6+ IF growth stalls and support is automated
- **Founder Validation Note**: Founder would pay "100% after test phase" - tests assumption that serious ADHD users will pay upfront for working solution

**Phase 2: Standard Tier**
- **Standard**: $9/month or $79/year (upgrade from $5 alpha, add habits + streaks + export)
- **Alpha Grandfathering**: Early users keep $5/month rate for 12 months (loyalty reward)
- **Target**: 200-300 paid users by Month 6

**Phase 3: Pro Tier Launch**
- **Standard**: $9/month (habit tracking, journaling, basic graph)
- **Pro**: $19/month or $159/year (AI consequence mapping, advanced graph, diagnostic/soft toggle, shared workspaces up to 5)
- **Optional**: $79 lifetime (Yellow-stage users who hate subscriptions)
- **Target**: 10% Standard users upgrade to Pro

**Phase 4+: Enterprise/Community**
- Teams: $15/user/month (admin controls, shared workspaces)
- Open-source core + managed cloud (Ghost/Supabase hybrid model)

**Original Freemium Rationale (Now Deprioritized):**
- ADHD market damaged by card-required trials (40% amnesia charge complaints)
- Executive dysfunction makes "sign up later" → never (card gates trigger avoidance)
- 4-6% ADHD freemium conversion beats 2.6% SaaS baseline when users STAY
- **Pre-mortem Override**: Paid-upfront reduces top-of-funnel 50% BUT filters serious users and validates demand immediately (worth tradeoff)

**Alternative Strategy Considered (Based on Assumption Reversals):**

**"Inverted Launch" Approach:**
- Ship Phase 3 features FIRST (graph + manual consequence tracking) as prototype
- Charge $5/month from Day 1 (filter for serious users, validate willingness-to-pay immediately)
- Let users build graph MANUALLY (engages ADHD hyperfocus, avoids AI distrust)
- Add capture/tasks polish LATER (Phase 1-2) based on user feedback
- Rationale: Validates differentiation (graph/consequences) before commodity features (capture)

**Pros of Inverted Approach:**
- Tests moat immediately (no 6-month wait for differentiation)
- Paid-first filters tire-kickers, reduces support burden
- Manual graph building engages ADHD complexity-seeking behavior
- Faster product-market fit validation (do users want consequence mapping?)

**Cons of Inverted Approach:**
- Higher barrier to entry (complex first = more friction)
- Smaller initial user base (paid + complex = fewer signups)
- Risk of over-engineering Phase 0 (founder's learning goals conflict)
- No journal data foundation (need 30 days for patterns)

**Decision: Compressed Hybrid Approach Chosen** ⚠️ UPDATED AFTER PRE-MORTEM
- Phase 0 (60 days): Journaling + capture + graph preview TOGETHER (compressed from 9-month sequential)
- Phase 0: PAID-FIRST $5/month (changed from freemium to validate demand immediately)
- Phase 0: Optional graph preview teaser (validate interest without full Phase 3 build)
- Phase 0: Manual consequence tracking (users draw connections, no AI yet)
- Phase 3: AI analyzes journal data collected since Phase 0 (validates sequential build)
- Validation: If beta users demand graph sooner, accelerate Phase 3 timeline
- **Pre-mortem Risk Mitigated**: 9-month wait for differentiation = competitors ship first; compressed to 60 days

**Founder Lived Experience Validation**: Founder's girlfriend said he's been "cold lately" - invisible self-change problem is REAL and happening NOW. This validates Phase 0 journaling priority. Founder would pay "100% after test phase" - reinterpreted as validation that serious users will pay upfront once they see value (alpha framing key). Founder said "Both!" when asked if systems thinking motivates or stresses, validating soft/diagnostic mode toggle. Founder answered "Simple is enough to fix my problems first," supporting sequential phasing BUT with compressed timeline. Strategy grounded in actual user (founder) validation.

### Validation Experiments (Assumption Reversal Tests)

**Test 1: Simplicity vs Complexity Preference**
- Show 5 beta users empty graph view in Phase 0: "This is where your life systems will appear"
- Measure: Does teaser increase retention (curiosity) or decrease (overwhelm)?
- Decision: If 4+ users engage positively, add graph preview to Phase 0 onboarding

**Test 2: Systems Thinking Anxiety vs Motivation**
- A/B test consequence messaging: Positive ("See what's working") vs Neutral ("See patterns")
- Ask users: "Does seeing life cascades motivate you or stress you out?"
- Decision: If 50%+ report anxiety, implement "soft mode" (hide negative cascades)

**Test 3: AI Trust and Privacy Concerns**
- Ask 10 beta users: "Would you trust AI analyzing your journal for patterns?"
- Offer manual consequence marking: "Mark when you think workout affects energy" → app confirms with data
- Decision: If 60%+ prefer manual, make AI opt-in (not default) in Phase 3

**Test 4: Capture as Commodity**
- Ask beta users: "You already have Apple Notes/Keep—why use Life.D for capture?"
- If answer is "just capture," test unique angles: voice → auto-categorize, quick-add to journal template
- Decision: If capture alone isn't compelling, ship consequence preview in Phase 0

**Test 5: Freemium vs Paid-First Willingness**
- Ask 10 beta users: "Would you pay $5/month from Day 1 for this tool?"
- Measure: 60%+ yes = consider paid-first or early "Supporter" tier
- Decision: Validates pricing strategy or pivots to paid trials
- 4-6% ADHD freemium conversion beats 2.6% SaaS baseline when users STAY
- Paid-upfront ($5/month day-1) boosts LTV 2x but reduces top-of-funnel 50%

**Alternative Strategy Considered (Based on Assumption Reversals):**

**"Inverted Launch" Approach:**
- Ship Phase 3 features FIRST (graph + manual consequence tracking) as prototype
- Charge $5/month from Day 1 (filter for serious users, validate willingness-to-pay immediately)
- Let users build graph MANUALLY (engages ADHD hyperfocus, avoids AI distrust)
- Add capture/tasks polish LATER (Phase 1-2) based on user feedback
- Rationale: Validates differentiation (graph/consequences) before commodity features (capture)

**Pros of Inverted Approach:**
- Tests moat immediately (no 6-month wait for differentiation)
- Paid-first filters tire-kickers, reduces support burden
- Manual graph building engages ADHD complexity-seeking behavior
- Faster product-market fit validation (do users want consequence mapping?)

**Cons of Inverted Approach:**
- Higher barrier to entry (complex first = more friction)
- Smaller initial user base (paid + complex = fewer signups)
- Risk of over-engineering Phase 0 (founder's learning goals conflict)
- No journal data foundation (need 30 days for patterns)

**Decision: Hybrid Approach Chosen**
- Phase 0: Journaling provides IMMEDIATE differentiation (self-change detection) on Day 1
- Phase 0: Freemium maintains low barrier BUT test "Supporter" tier willingness
- Phase 0: Optional graph preview teaser (validate interest without building full feature)
- Phase 3: AI analyzes journal data collected since Phase 0 (validates sequential build)
- Validation: If beta users demand graph sooner, accelerate Phase 3 timeline

**Founder Lived Experience Validation**: Founder's girlfriend said he's been "cold lately" - invisible self-change problem is REAL and happening NOW. This validates Phase 0 journaling priority over Phase 0 graph. Founder would pay "100% after test phase" (not Day 1), validating freemium approach. Founder said "Both!" when asked if systems thinking motivates or stresses, validating the soft/diagnostic mode toggle planned for Phase 3. Founder answered "Simple is enough to fix my problems first," directly supporting sequential phasing over inverted approach. Strategy grounded in actual user (founder) validation.

### Open Questions for Validation

1. Can Phase 0 ship in 30 days given current life commitments (girlfriend moving in)? **[Low concern—senior SRE with AI acceleration]**
2. Will 10 beta ADHD testers provide sufficient feedback, or need 50+?
3. What's the optimal life-systems journal template structure? (Relationships/Work/Self-care/Energy/Mood + open-ended?)
4. What journal completion rate validates engagement? (40%+ days/week? 60%+?)
5. How soon can users detect self-changes? (7 days? 14 days? 30 days of journaling?)
6. Should shared workspaces ship sooner to keep girlfriend engaged as stakeholder? **[NEW URGENCY: She could be beta tester #1 for relationship tracking]**
7. Is "Life.D" name immediately clear, or does it need tagline ("Life Direction for ADHD brains")?
8. How to message "systems thinking" to Orange-stage ADHD users without Yellow jargon?
9. What's the minimum graph data (30 days? 60 days?) before consequence patterns are meaningful?
10. Should micro-influencer budget ($5K-10K) come from savings or wait for revenue?
11. **NEW:** Does showing empty graph in Phase 0 increase or decrease retention?
12. **NEW:** Do users prefer manual consequence marking over AI-discovered patterns?
13. **NEW:** What's the right balance between positive framing ("see wins") and diagnostic truth ("see breakdowns")? **[ANSWERED: Both—implement toggle]**
14. **NEW:** What % of users demand graph view after 30 days of journaling? (Threshold: 60%+ = accelerate Phase 3)
15. **NEW:** Does "ecosystem integration" messaging resonate more than "best capture" or "graph visualization" in user interviews?

## Pre-mortem: Failure Scenarios & Prevention

### The Failure Scenario (November 2026)

Life.D shuts down after 12 months with 47 active users, $180 MRR, and a burned-out founder. Working backwards:

**IMMEDIATE CAUSES:**
- Running costs ($325/month) exceed revenue
- Support burden (15+ hours/week) from free users unsustainable
- Founder exhaustion from solo complex product + day job
- Relationship strain (ironic given journaling trigger)

**PROXIMATE CAUSES (Months 6-12):**
1. **Phase 0 Trap**: Journaling felt like "another notes app" - no visible differentiation, 85% churned within 14 days before experiencing core value (requires 30+ days data)
2. **Ecosystem Integration Nightmare**: OAuth issues, API changes, 40% of support tickets = "Why isn't sync working?"
3. **Freemium Death Spiral**: 200 free users × 6% conversion = 12 paid × $9 = $108 MRR (never hit critical mass)
4. **ADHD Founder's Paradox**: Hyperfocus on graph architecture (interesting) while Phase 0 UX languished (needed)
5. **Competition Blindside**: Notion shipped AI journaling (June 2026), Motion.app added graph view (August 2026) - moat evaporated before Phase 3

**ROOT CAUSES (Months 0-6):**
- ❌ Validation theater: 10 beta users (friends) gave polite feedback, not brutal truth
- ❌ Sequential phasing too slow: 9 months to differentiation in fast-moving market
- ❌ Solo founder, complex product: Graph DB + Flutter + AI + integrations = 3-person job minimum
- ❌ No growth engine: No viral loops, referral system, or content marketing
- ❌ Technology risk: Apache AGE scaling issues at 200 users
- ❌ Life disruption: Girlfriend moving in during critical launch window
- ❌ No runway: Living off savings = pressure to monetize immediately (bad decisions)

### Prevention Plan (Applied to This Brief)

**1. COMPRESSED TIMELINE** ⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE
- **Risk Identified**: 9 months to differentiation = competitors ship first
- **New Approach**: 60-day compressed MVP ships Phase 0 + graph preview + manual consequence tracking TOGETHER
- **Tradeoff**: Quality vs. speed - frame as "alpha," charge from Day 1 to filter serious users
- **Applied**: See updated Timeline Constraints section

**2. PRE-SALES VALIDATION GATE** ⚠️ CRITICAL ADDITION
- **Risk Identified**: Building without demand proof
- **New Requirement**: Landing page with "$49/year founding member" CTA
- **Threshold**: 50 email signups + 10 pre-sales ($490) BEFORE writing code
- **Kill Criteria**: If gate fails, pivot or shut down project

**3. ELIMINATE ECOSYSTEM INTEGRATIONS FROM MVP** ⚠️ SCOPE REDUCTION
- **Risk Identified**: Infinite support burden + technical debt from OAuth/API issues
- **Changed**: Remove Todoist/Google Calendar/Apple Health sync from Phase 0-2 entirely
- **Alternative**: CSV export/import only - let power users DIY
- **Re-add Rule**: Only if 50+ users request same integration

**4. CO-FOUNDER REQUIREMENT** ⚠️ CRITICAL GATE
- **Risk Identified**: Solo founder burnout on complex product
- **New Gate**: Recruit technical OR marketing co-founder by Month 3, OR:
  - Hire freelance Flutter dev (10 hours/week, $5K budget), OR
  - Partner with ADHD coach (equity split, they bring users)
- **Kill Criteria**: If no co-founder/support by Month 3, shut down gracefully

**5. PAID-FIRST MODEL (NOT FREEMIUM)** ⚠️ REVENUE MODEL CHANGE
- **Risk Identified**: Freemium death spiral - free users demand features faster than paid can fund
- **Changed**: $5/month from Day 1, NO free tier until Month 6 (if at all)
- **Rationale**: Validates willingness-to-pay immediately, filters serious users, funds development
- **Counter-Objection**: "But ADHD + card gates!" → Test assumption NOW: serious users will pay for working solution

**6. ANTI-SCOPE-CREEP RULES** ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS
- ❌ NO features outside Phase 0-3 scope without 10+ user requests
- ❌ NO architecture rewrites unless blocking growth
- ❌ NO AI experiments until core capture has 60%+ DAU
- ✅ YES to ugly but functional
- ✅ YES to manual processes (until they must scale)

**7. MARKETING FROM DAY 1** ⚠️ CRITICAL ADDITION (see new section below)

**8. METRICS-DRIVEN KILL CRITERIA** ⚠️ FAILURE GATES
- **Month 1**: <20 paid users = pause, interview non-converters
- **Month 3**: <$500 MRR = pivot or shut down
- **Month 6**: <1000 MAU OR <$2K MRR = re-evaluate strategy
- **Month 9**: Founder >25 hours/week on support = hire or automate
- **Ongoing**: Founder relationship quality declining = immediate workload reduction

## Timeline Constraints

### Phase 0: Compressed MVP (Quick Capture + Journaling + Graph Preview)
- **Timeline:** December 2025 - January 2026 (60 days) ⚠️ COMPRESSED FROM 9-MONTH SEQUENTIAL
- **Pre-Development Gate**: 50 email signups + 10 pre-sales ($490) from landing page
- **Milestones:**
  - Week 1-2: Flutter skeleton, Supabase auth, landing page validation
  - Week 3-4: Quick capture UI/UX, voice notes
  - Week 5-6: Life-systems journaling templates (Relationships/Work/Energy/Mood)
  - Week 7-8: Graph preview teaser (static visualization, manual connection drawing)
  - Week 8: Beta with 20 ADHD users (paid $5/month from Day 1)
- **Launch:** Alpha pricing $5/month, NO free tier
- **Revenue Goal:** $100-250 MRR (20-50 paid users) - validates willingness-to-pay immediately
- **Kill Gate:** <20 paid users by end of Month 1 = pause for interviews
- **Scope Cuts Applied:**
  - ❌ NO ecosystem integrations (Todoist, Google Calendar removed)
  - ❌ NO AI features (deferred to Month 3)
  - ❌ NO polished UI (functional > beautiful)
  - ✅ YES to manual consequence tracking (users draw connections)
  - ✅ YES to ugly graph preview (validates interest without full Phase 3 build)

### Phase 1: Task System + Reminders
- **Timeline:** February 2026 (30 days)
- **Milestones:**
  - Week 1-2: Task creation, deadlines, priorities
  - Week 3: Reminder system, notification logic
  - Week 4: Recurring tasks, templates
  - Launch: $5/month continues, aiming for 100 paid users
- **Revenue Goal:** $500 MRR by end Phase 1
- **Kill Gate:** <$300 MRR by Month 3 = re-evaluate or shut down
- **Success Gate:** 50% retention at 30 days, requests for habit tracking

### Phase 2: Habits + Dopamine Engine
- **Timeline:** March-April 2026 (60 days)
- **Milestones:**
  - Month 1: Habit tracking, streaks, milestone metrics
  - Month 2: Before/after comparisons, consequence annotations
  - Launch: Standard tier $9/month (upgrade from $5 alpha), 200+ paid users target
- **Revenue Goal:** $1.5K MRR by end of Phase 2
- **Kill Gate:** <$1K MRR OR <1000 MAU by Month 6 = pivot or shut down

### Phase 3: Systems Thinking Unlock
- **Timeline:** May-July 2026 (90 days)
- **Milestones:**
  - Month 1: Graph database integration (Postgres + AGE), auto-generation from journal data
  - Month 2: AI consequence pattern detection (local LLMs), diagnostic/soft mode toggle
  - Month 3: Pro tier launch ($19/month), shared workspaces beta
- **Revenue Goal:** $3K-5K MRR by end of Phase 3 (300-400 paid users)
- **Kill Gate:** Founder working >25 hours/week on support = hire contractor or automate
- **Co-Founder Gate:** Must have technical/marketing co-founder OR freelance support by Month 7

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Pre-sales validation gate** (50 emails + 10 pre-sales) blocks Phase 0 development start ⚠️ NEW
2. Phase 0 personal validation (20 paid users) blocks Phase 1 start
3. Phase 2 habit data blocks Phase 3 graph meaningfulness
4. 30 days consistent usage required before graph unlocks (hard requirement)
5. **Co-founder recruitment** by Month 3 blocks continued solo development ⚠️ NEW

### Validation Gates & Kill Criteria

**Pre-Development:**
- ❌ KILL: Landing page fails to get 50 email signups in 2 weeks
- ❌ KILL: <10 pre-sales ($490 total) in 4 weeks
- ✅ PROCEED: Hit both thresholds = start development

**Month 1 (Phase 0):**
- ⚠️ PAUSE: <20 paid users by end of Month 1 = conduct 10 user interviews before continuing
- ❌ KILL: 0 users willing to pay $5/month = fundamental demand problem

**Month 3 (Phase 1):**
- ❌ KILL: <$300 MRR = insufficient traction, pivot or shut down
- ⚠️ WARNING: No co-founder/contractor identified = burnout risk escalating

**Month 6 (Phase 2):**
- ❌ KILL: <$1K MRR OR <1000 MAU = missed critical mass
- ❌ KILL: Churn rate >15%/month = retention problem unsolved

**Month 9 (Phase 3):**
- ⚠️ MANDATE: Founder working >25 hours/week on support = hire contractor or automate
- ⚠️ MANDATE: Relationship quality declining = immediate workload reduction

**Ongoing Health Checks:**
- Weekly founder energy/motivation rating (1-10 scale)
- If <5 for 3 consecutive weeks = reassess commitment
- Monthly relationship check-in (girlfriend as stakeholder)

### External Constraints
- Girlfriend moving in: December 2025 (may reduce dev time weeks 2-4)
- Holiday season: Late Dec-early Jan (expect slower beta recruitment)
- Content/community building: Must run parallel to dev (blog posts weeks 1-4)
